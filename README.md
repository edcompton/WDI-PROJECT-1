# WDI-PROJECT-1
Endless runner javascript game.

The aim of Jump 'n Run is to get as far as you can through the levels, avoiding the enemies coming from the right hand side of the screen. 

##Javascript Overview

The 2 main problems to solve in making the game were;

- Generating objects to animate from right to left across the game screen

- Creating collision logic that ensured that when the character hit an objet a Game Over was triggered

##Gameplay

The character, positioned at the left of the screen, has to avoid the oncoming objects.
